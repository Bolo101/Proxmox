Another way to install Proxmox-Ve on top of a Debian12 with an offline method is being investigated but many conflict are met so far.
Offline installation on a native Proxmox-Ve installed using the original iso file is also working.
Online installation method is fully operationnal on a system running Debian12 Bookworm with a wired Internet connection.
